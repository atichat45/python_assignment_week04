**Assignment 4: Defining Functions in Python**  
Define and use functions in Python to perform specific tasks.    
**Instructions:**  
1. Create a new Python file named `calculator.py`.  
2. Define a function named `add` that takes two arguments and returns their sum.

5. Define a function named `divide` that takes two arguments and returns their quotient.  
6. Write a main block that calls each function with sample inputs and prints the results.  


**Assignment 5: Using Lambda Functions in Python**  
Rewrite the functions from Assignment 4 using lambda functions.  
**Instructions:**  
1. Create a new Python file named `lambda_calculator.py`.

4. Define a lambda function for multiplication that takes two arguments and returns their product.  
5. Define a lambda function for division that takes two arguments and returns their quotient.  
6. Write a main block that calls each lambda function with sample inputs and prints the results.  


**Assignment 6: Importing Modules in Python**  
Import and use modules in Python to enhance functionality.  
Instructions:  
1. Create a new Python file named `string_operations.py`.  
2. Define functions for common string operations:  
    - `reverse_string`: Reverses a given string.  
    - `capitalize_string`: Capitalizes the first letter of a given string.  
    - `lowercase_string`: Converts all characters in a given string to lowercase.  
    - `uppercase_string`: Converts all characters in a given string to uppercase.  
3. Create another Python file named `main.py`.  
4. Import the `string_operations` module in `main.py`.  
5. Use the imported functions to perform operations on sample strings and print the results.  
Example of main.py  
```python  
# Importing the string_operations module  
import string_operations as so  

# Sample strings and printing results  
sample_string = "hello World"  

print("Original:", sample_string)  
print("Reversed:", so.reverse_string(sample_string))  
print("Capitalized:", so.capitalize_string(sample_string))  
print("Lowercase:", so.lowercase_string(sample_string))  
print("Uppercase:", so.uppercase_string(sample_string))  
```

Assignment 7: Creating Packages in Python  
Organize your code into packages to improve modularity and reusability. Use the knowledge from Assignments 4 and 6.  
**Instructions:**  
1. Create a directory named `utilities`.  
2. Inside `utilities`, create an `__init__.py` file.  
3. Create a module named `calculator.py` inside `utilities` and include the functions defined in Assignment 4.  
5. Create a module named `string_operations.py` inside `utilities` and include the functions defined in Assignment 6.  
6. Create another Python file named `main.py` outside the `utilities` directory.  
7. Import functions from all three modules (`calculator` and `string_operations`) in `main.py`.  
8. Use the imported functions to perform operations and print the results.  
Example of main.py  
```python  
# Importing modules from the utilities package
from utilities.calculator import add as add_def, subtract as subtract_def, multiply as multiply_def, divide as divide_def  
from utilities.string_operations import reverse_string, capitalize_string, lowercase_string, uppercase_string  

# Sample inputs and printing results using calculator.py  
print("Using calculator.py:")  
print("Addition:", add_def(10, 5))  
print("Subtraction:", subtract_def(10, 5))  
print("Multiplication:", multiply_def(10, 5))  
print("Division:", divide_def(10, 5))v

# Sample strings and printing results using string_operations.py  
sample_string = "hello World"  
print("\nUsing string_operations.py:")  
print("Original:", sample_string)  
print("Reversed:", reverse_string(sample_string))  
print("Capitalized:", capitalize_string(sample_string))  
print("Lowercase:", lowercase_string(sample_string))  
print("Uppercase:", uppercase_string(sample_string))  

```  

Expected output:  
Using calculator.py:  
Addition: 15  
Subtraction: 5  
Multiplication: 50v
Division: 2.0  

Using string_operations.py:  
Original: hello World  
Reversed: dlroW olleh  
Capitalized: Hello world  
Lowercase: hello world  
Uppercase: HELLO WORLD  


**Assignment 8: Filtering and Modifying a List of Student Grades**  
Imagine you have a list of student grades and you need to create a list of students who have passed (with grades 60 and above) and give a 5% bonus to those grades.  
**Instruction**:  
1. Define a list of integers named `grades` containing student grades.  
   grades = [55, 70, 65, 40, 90, 85, 50, 77]  
2. Use a list comprehension to create a new list named `passed_with_bonus` that:  
    - Filters the grades to include only those that are 60 and above.  
    - Applies a 5% bonus to each of the filtered grades.  
3. Print the `passed_with_bonus` list to display the modified grades.  
Expected Output:  
Grades after filtering and applying bonus: [73.5, 68.25, 94.5, 89.25, 80.85]  


**Assignment 9: Filtering Eligible Children for a Fun Park**  
Imagine you have a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains a child's name, age, and height. You need to create a new list of children who are eligible to join a fun park. A child is eligible if their age is greater than 3 and their height is greater than 100 cm.  
**Instructions:**  
1. Define a list of dictionaries named `children`, where each dictionary contains a `name`, `age`, and `height`.  
   children = [ {"name": "Alice", "age": 2, "height": 95}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 4, "height": 105}, {"name": "Charlie", "age": 3, "height": 110}, {"name": "David", "age": 5, "height": 102}, {"name": "Eve", "age": 6, "height": 99} ]  
2. Use a list comprehension to create a new list named `eligible_children` that:  
    - Filters the children to include only those with age greater than 3 and height greater than 100 cm.  
3. Print the `eligible_children` list to display the names, ages, and heights of the eligible children.  
**Expected Output:**  
Eligible children for the fun park: [{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 4, 'height': 105}, {'name': 'David', 'age': 5, 'height': 102}]  


**Assignment 10: Filtering Eligible Children for a Fun Park (Using Lambda Function)**  
Student can incorporate a lambda function into the list comprehension for filtering eligible children.  
**Instructions:**v
1. Define a list of dictionaries named `children`, where each dictionary contains a `name`, `age`, and `height`.  
   children = [ {"name": "Alice", "age": 2, "height": 95}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 4, "height": 105}, {"name": "Charlie", "age": 3, "height": 110}, {"name": "David", "age": 5, "height": 102}, {"name": "Eve", "age": 6, "height": 99} ]  
2. Use a lambda function named criteria to define the eligibility criteria. `criteria` is a lambda function that takes a dictionary `child` and returns `True` if the child's age is greater than 3 and height is greater than 100 cm.  
3. Print the `eligible_children` list to display the names, ages, and heights of the eligible children.  
**Expected Output:**  
Eligible children for the fun park: [{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 4, 'height': 105}, {'name': 'David', 'age': 5, 'height': 102}]
